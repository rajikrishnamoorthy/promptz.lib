# CDK Project Structure

# CDK Project Structure Rules

## File Naming Conventions

### General Naming Rules

- Use kebab-case for directory names: `data-storage/`, `search/`
- Use kebab-case for file names: `search-stack.ts`, `lambda-function.ts`
- Use PascalCase for class names: `SearchStack`, `LambdaFunction`
- Use camelCase for variable and function names: `createInstance`, `databaseConfig`

### Stack Files

- Name stack files with the `-stack` suffix: `search-stack.ts`
- Name construct files descriptively based on their purpose: `application-database.ts`, `api-gateway.ts`

### Test Files

- Name test files with the `.test.ts` suffix
- Match test file names to the files they are testing: `search-stack.test.ts`

## Folder Organization

```

- Group stacks and related constructs by its bounded contexts in dedicated directories under `lib/`
- Group constructs and utitlities shared across multiple bounded contexts in the `common/` folder.

## Separation of Logic and Configuration

### Configuration Management

- Store environment-specific configuration in the `config/` directory
- Use TypeScript interfaces to define configuration shapes
- Never hardcode environment-specific values in construct code

### Environment Context

- Use the CDK context to determine the name of the deployment environment
- Load the appropriate configuration based on the environment
